# CS4012 Lab 2 - Reversible Interpreter

I struggled with this one and it got put aside during the exams so I am just submitting what I have.

For part 2 I take in a .txt file which has each Statement on a separate line. I read in the lines and create a list of Statements.
The user is then prompted for input until they have executed each statement or they quit.

## How to run 
From the `interpreter/` directory (the stack project root)  
`$ stack setup`  
`$ stack build`  
`$ stack exec interpreter-exe`

`n` to execute the next statement.

`q` to quit
