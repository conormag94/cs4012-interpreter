# CS4012 Lab 2 - Reversible Interpreter

I struggled with this one and it got put aside during the exams so I am just submitting what I have.

## How to run 
From the `interpreter/` directory (the stack project root)
`$ stack setup`
`$ stack build`
`$ stack exec interpreter-exe`

`n` to execute the next statement
`q` to quit

## How much of each section I have completed

- 4 [10 marks]: 0%
- 5 [10 marks]: 0%
